        <h2>minesweeper sample webservice</h2>
        <p>
            This is a toy webservice for a hypothetical factory of "minesweeper" games.
            <br>
            The idea is that given a minefield, the service creates the hints for it and either returns
            them directly or stores them for later retrieval.
        </p>
        <p>
            To submit a minefield, POST a payload giving the dimensions of the minefield, followed by
            the field itself. Empty spaces are marked as '.', mines are marked as '*'.
            <br>
            For example the following POST payload:
            <pre>
{
    "height": 5,
    "width": 4,
    "minefield" : [
        "....",
        ".*..",
        "....",
        "..*.",
        "...."
    ]
}
            </pre>
        Would yield the following result:
        <pre>
[
    "1110",
    "1*10",
    "1221",
    "01*1",
    "0111"
]
        </pre>
        </p>
    </body>
